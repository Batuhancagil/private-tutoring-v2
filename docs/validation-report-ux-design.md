## Strengths
1.  **Deep Collaboration:** Every major UX decision (Color, Layout, Timeline, Mobile) was made by the user after seeing visual options.
2.  **Novel Component Definition:** The "Dual-Mode Timeline" solves a specific domain problem (Planning vs Tracking) identified during the session.
3.  **Clear Role Separation:** The specification clearly distinguishes between the Teacher's desktop management experience and the Student's mobile logging experience.

## Recommended Actions
**Ready for next phase?** Yes - Proceed to Solution Architecture.

The UX specification provides clear guidance for the technical architecture, specifically the need for a complex React timeline component that supports two distinct viewing modes.
